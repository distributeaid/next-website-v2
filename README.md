# About Distribute Aid

Distribute Aid (DA) delivers humanitarian aid to communities in need.

By coordinating end-to-end shipments, we make it easy for donors to connect with frontline aid organisations, understand the needs on the ground, and get their aid delivered.

# ðŸš€ Getting started with Gitpod

Gitpod provides a fully automated development environment for your Next.js project, and the development environment is set up with just a single click. Follow these steps to get started:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/distributeaid/next-website-v2)

1. Click the `Open in Gitpod` button above. Note: you'll need to have an account on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/login/) before proceeding with the next steps (this requires a GitHub account).
2. Click the `Continue` button.
3. Relax, a development environment is being set up for you in the first terminal.
4. To access your workspace later, go to [Gitpod Workspaces](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). Pin the `next-website-v2` workspace to prevent auto-deletion after 14 days by clicking the three dots next to the workspace name and selecting "Pin".

## Setup

This setup comes preconfigured with Nextjs, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next's Incremental Static Regeneration

To run a Nextjs project you'll need to install or update these dependencies:

- [Node.js 18.17 or later](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/SpaceyaTech/mentorlst-dashboard/blob/main/README.md) - to update Node.js

## Installation

Here are the steps to set up the project in your local dev environment:

1. Install Dependencies:

```Bash
- yarn install
```

2.Then run the development server to launch your app:

```Bash
yarn run dev
```

3.Open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Branching & Workflows

We'll have a long-running branch(saga) and short-lived branches that will be used to develop parts of the website. An example of a short-lived branch would be feat/about-us. Always ensure you're working on a seperate branch to avoid merge conflicts

## Running checks

To check types:

```Bash
yarn run check:types
```

To run the linter:

```Bash
yarn run lint
```

## Crafting commit messages

When crafting commit messages, try to group commits that are related to a particular topic. For example, if you're making commits related to the styling, only include files that are related to styling. This makes it easier to read through the commits and see the exact files that made changes to the styles.

A good commit message will ideally have the following attributes:

- Subject => A summary of what you did in the commit.
- Body => A detailed explanation of the commit.
- Proper commits make debugging easier in cases where we need to go through our git logs.

## Crafting a Pull Request (PR)

- Include the purpose of the Pull Request and link the issue related to the PR

- Consider providing an overview of why the work is taking place (with any relevant links). Don't assume familiarity with the history

- Be explicit about what feedback you want, if any: a quick pair of \*\* on the code, discussion on the technical approach, critique on design, a review copy

- Be explicit about when you want feedback, if the Pull Request is a work in progress, say so. Prefix the title of your PR with [WIP]

- @mention individuals that you specifically want to involve in the discussion and explain the help or input you need from them.

Happy coding!!!
