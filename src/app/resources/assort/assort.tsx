              The Aid Standards for Sorting (ASSORT) are a set of
              interoperability standards for humanitarian aid that are designed
              to save grassroots organisations time, effort, and money.
            </p>
            <p>
              When quality control and sorting are not standardised,
              inefficiencies arise. These inefficiencies require significant
              expenditure of resources:

                Quality Control - the receiver may have to pay to dispose of
                items that are culturally inappropriate, out of season, or poor
                in quality.

                Sorting - 100,000 aid items on a shipment might be sorted one
                way by the sender and then re-sorted another way by the
                receiver. Sorting takes time.

              ASSORT leads to faster, cheaper, and more responsive aid. By
              providing a “common language” for aid donations, organisations
              receiving aid can know ahead of time what is on an aid shipment.
              When the shipment arrives, they process it much faster than they
              otherwise could. Indeed, a pilot shipment showed that using ASSORT
              standards significantly cut down on the receiving organisation’s
              sorting and processing time. Saving time and volunteer capacity
              makes a big difference for grassroots aid organisations.
