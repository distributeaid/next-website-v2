    "What is HRT?",

      <Text as="p">
        <strong>A:</strong> HRT is short for Hormone Replacement Therapy, which
        is also known as Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy (GAHT). HRT also
        happens to be the beginning letters of <strong>H</strong>arm{" "}
        <strong>R</strong>eduction <strong>T</strong>oolkit. So we’re playing a
        bit with words and acronyms here.

        Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy has been linked to better mental health
        outcomes for trans and nonbinary people, lowering suicidal ideation and
        increasing happiness. You can find out more about this via the{" "}

    "What’s in an HRT kit? Are you distributing hormones?",
    <>
      <Text as="p">
        <strong>A:</strong> We do not distribute hormones. We only assemble the
        sundries needed to administer hormone replacement therapy. These include
        syringes, needles in various gauges, disinfectant wipes, and a sharps
        disposal container to safely dispose of needles. Each kit provides
        supplies for one trans person for one year.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p">
        A regular, accessible, affordable supply of clean needles is essential
        to reduce the harms associated with needle reuse and sharing.

    "Why do trans people need these things and why can’t they just buy them?",
    <>
      <Text as="p">
        <strong>A:</strong> While $65 for yearly supplies may not seem like a
        lot of money for many people, it’s an expense that many trans people who
        are already more likely to be in precarious economical situations cannot
        cover. This may force them to choose between important medical care and
        buying groceries. They also generally end up paying much more than $65
        because they cannot afford to buy supplies in one go, which drives up
        the price.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p">
        Thanks to our extensive aid partners and grassroots network, Distribute
        Aid can source these supplies far more efficiently, effectively bringing
        the actual price per kit down further to $10 per kit.

        <strong>A:</strong> Distribute Aid sources the materials (in-kind
        donations or financial donations that enable us to buy the resources),
        which are then assembled by volunteers in various production hubs around
        the southern US. The kits are then sent to various established frontline
        partners, such as community organisations or mutual aid hubs, who then
        distribute them to trans people within their communities.

      <Text as="p">
        <strong>A:</strong> If you are in need of an HRT Harm Reduction Toolkit,
        we recommend getting in touch with your local frontline organisation,
        mutual aid hub, etc. and asking them if they want to get involved.
        Frontline groups can then reach out to us to sign up to become
        distributors for these kits.

    "How did this project start?",

      <Text as="p">
        <strong>A:</strong> The escalating attacks on transgender people in the
        US after November 2024 led to our decision to do something to
        specifically support trans people. We{" "}
        <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/borderless.bsky.social/post/3lda7sebxqk2e">
          started our campaign
        </a>{" "}
        in December 2024 and fairly quickly raised an impressive amount of
        funds, which we then put to use sourcing the materials needed to safely
        administer gender-affirming hormone therapy or Hormone Replacement
        Therapy (HRT). Thanks to our established network of partners and our
        experience distributing aid worldwide we can source ingredients at a
        much lower cost. In addition, we collect in-kind donations as well. The
        toolkits are assembled by volunteers in various hubs and are then
        distributed to trans people in need for free by frontline organisations.

      <Text as="p">
        We plan to keep this project going as long as we can and as long as it’s
        needed and will be looking into extending the reach of the project
        whenever possible.
