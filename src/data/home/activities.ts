      "Distribute Aid is actively working to prevent the spread of COVID globally. We regularly send hygiene and PPE shipments to our European partners who continue to work to protect people in crowded refugee camps. Because COVID affects everybody, our response grew as the virus spread. We now also collaborate with multiple grassroots networks in the US to support their response.",

      "Distribute Aid builds disaster response networks by connecting grassroots groups with the supplies, infrastructure, and coordination they need to respond quickly and effectively. We help local organizations prepare before disasters strike by securing warehouse space, stockpiling essentials, and enabling cross-state collaboration so communities are able to respond to disasters within days rather than weeks. In the US, our model was used to respond to Hurricane Helene in 2024 and the LA fires in 2025.",
